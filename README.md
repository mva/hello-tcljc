## Project Template for `tcljc`

This repository serves as a basic project template, using the classic
"hello world" program.

### Prerequisites

- Linux.  Has not been tested with Window or macOS *at all*.

- A build of [OpenJDK](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk) tagged
  `jdk-21+14` or later that includes the in-development Classfile API
  ([draft JEP](https://openjdk.org/jeps/8280389)).  Please note that
  it is currently considered an *internal* library and is expected to
  move to a *preview API library* over time.  For more information,
  see [Classfile API implementation merged to
  JDK](https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/classfile-api-dev/2023-March/000228.html).

- A copy of `tcljc`'s modules matching the OpenJDK build from
  repository
  [bootstrap-tcljc](https://github.com/mva/bootstrap-tcljc).  As long
  as there are no releases, the modules are distributed as a
  repository of classfiles.

### Running the Thing

`Makefile` lists the most common commands.  They come as classic
one-shot invocations (like `make compile`), and as `watch-â€¦` targets
(like `make watch-and-test`).  The latter start the compiler in a
looping mode.  Each time a source file changes, a recompile is
triggered and on success a parameterless function is called.

The makefile reads two environment variables:

- `JAVA_HOME` must point to the OpenJDK build and the JVM executable
  `$JAVE_HOME/bin/java` will be used.  Default is
  `~/local/jdk-classfile`.

- `TCLJC_MDIR` is the bootstrap-tcljc directory holding the three
  modules that comprise the compiler: runtime, core libraries, and the
  compiler itself.  Default is `../bootstrap-tcljc`.
